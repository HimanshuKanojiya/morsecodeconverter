# Morse Code Converter
This program is to convert and decode the plain text/morse code.

## What is Morse Code?

Morse code is a character encoding scheme used in telecommunication that encodes text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations called dots and dashes or dits and dahs.
You can read More about it at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code

## How does my morse code converter work or instructions to use my morse code converter program?

**Let's understand working with a short example:**

For example, the letter A is coded as ·−, letter Q is coded as −−·−, and digit 1 is coded as ·−−−−. The Morse code is case-insensitive, traditionally capital letters are used. When the message is written in Morse code, a single space is used to separate the character codes and 3 spaces are used to separate words.

### Intrunctions to Use:

**Suppose I wanna convert "My Name is Himanshu" into morse code. For this, I need to complete these below steps:**

> Step 1: We will choose option 1 which is  "Convert Your Text into Morse Code".

> Step 2: Then, We will write the above text which is "My Name is Himanshu".

> Step 3: After pressing enter button, We will get > -- -.--   -. .- -- .   .. ...   .... .. -- .- -. ... .... ..-

**For converting Morse Code to Readable Format, you need to do these steps:**

> Step 1: We will choose option 2 which is  "Convert Morse Code into Readable Text".

> Step 2: Now, we will write the Morse Code "-- -.--   -. .- -- .   .. ...   .... .. -- .- -. ... .... ..-" to convert into readable format.

> Step 3: Now, We will get the text "MY NAME IS HIMANSHU".
